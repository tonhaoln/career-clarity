# Inputs

Drop your career materials here.

## What to include

- **LinkedIn profile** - Copy-paste the text, or export as PDF
- **Old resume** - Any format (PDF, Word, whatever)
- **Portfolio URL** - Or paste relevant content directly
- **Project notes** - Case studies, documentation, anything
- **Recommendations** - LinkedIn recommendations if you have them

## Tips

- More is better. The agents will sort through it.
- Don't worry about formatting. Raw is fine.
- Include old stuff. Patterns emerge across your whole career.
- Add context. A note explaining a project helps.

## File naming

Doesn't matter. Name files whatever makes sense to you.

## Ready?

Once your materials are here, go back to the main folder and run:

```
