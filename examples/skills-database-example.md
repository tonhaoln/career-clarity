## Language Notes

| Instead of... | Say... | Why |
|--------------|--------|-----|
| "Led discovery" | "Conducted customer interviews" or "Clarified requirements with stakeholders" | Be specific about what I actually did |
| "Full-stack designer" | "Designer who codes" | More honest, less buzzy |
| "UX research" | "Usability testing" or "Customer interviews" | I do lightweight research, not dedicated UX research |

## Gaps & Development

- **Backend:** Basic understanding from side project, but not deep. Currently learning more SQL.
- **Motion design:** Can do basic transitions, but not complex animation. Want to learn Framer Motion.
- **Leadership:** Have mentored juniors informally. No direct reports yet.

---

## Notes

- LinkedIn recommendations mention: "great at simplifying complex interfaces", "actually listens in user sessions", "rare designer who understands code constraints"
- Left Bench because company ran out of runway, not performance
- Open to contract work - have done a few small projects on the side
