## Positioning Statement

Product designer who codes, specialising in B2B SaaS dashboards and complex workflows.

---

## Target Roles

### 1. Senior Product Designer (B2B SaaS)
**Why it fits:** 8 years design experience, last 6 years specifically in B2B. Deep experience with dashboards, data visualisation, and complex workflows. Can speak to engineers in their language.
**Gaps to address:** None significant. This is the sweet spot.

### 2. Design Engineer / UX Engineer
**Why it fits:** Already writing React, built production apps, comfortable in codebases. Combines design thinking with implementation ability. Growing demand for this hybrid role.
**Gaps to address:** Would need to strengthen React skills for a pure engineering role. Currently "comfortable" not "senior."

### 3. Product Designer (Design Systems)
**Why it fits:** Built and maintained design systems at two companies. Understand the Figma-to-code pipeline. Experience with Storybook documentation.
**Gaps to address:** Haven't led a design system team - have been sole maintainer. Would need to demonstrate leadership ability.

---

## Company Preferences

**Type:** Startup (Series A-B) or Scale-up. Not enterprise - too slow. Not early seed - too unstable.

**Size:** 20-100 people. Big enough to have product-market fit, small enough that design has a seat at the table.

**Industry:** B2B SaaS preferred. Open to fintech, dev tools, analytics. Avoid: healthcare (too regulated), crypto (too volatile), adtech (not interesting).

**Location:** Remote | Australian timezone (UTC+10/11). Would consider Sydney hybrid if the role was exceptional.

---

## Work Style

**Employment:** Full-time preferred. Open to long-term contract (6+ months) for the right opportunity.

**What energises me:**
- Simplifying complex interfaces
- Shipping real features, not just mockups
- Working directly with engineers
- Seeing metrics improve after a launch

**What drains me:**
- Endless stakeholder alignment
- Design by committee
- Pixel-pushing without context
- Companies that treat design as "making it pretty"

---

## Compensation (optional)

**Floor:** $140k AUD base. Below this doesn't make sense given experience level.

**Market range:** Senior product designers in AU remote roles seem to be $140-180k. Design engineers slightly higher.

**Notes:** Would consider lower base for meaningful equity in a company I believe in. Wouldn't trade salary for "exposure" or "learning opportunities."

- [ ] Reach out to 1 warm lead
- [ ] Update portfolio with one case study

## Notes

- Design engineer roles are growing but still rare in AU market - might need to look at US remote companies
- Should probably build one more side project to strengthen "designer who codes" positioning
- Budgeteer (side project) is good proof but could use a proper case study write-up
- Avoid applying to companies where design reports to marketing - red flag
