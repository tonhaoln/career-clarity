# Examples

Real-looking examples to help you understand what the outputs should look like.

## What's here

- **skills-database-example.md** - A complete skills database for "Sam", a fictional product designer with 8 years experience
- **target-strategy-example.md** - Sam's target strategy showing positioning, target roles, company preferences, and warm leads

## How to use these

Don't copy the content - Sam's experience isn't yours.

Instead, use these to:
- See what level of detail to aim for
- Understand what each section should contain
- Get a feel for the tone and language

Then create your own from scratch using the agents.
